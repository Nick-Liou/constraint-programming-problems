## Problem Overview: Pass me that power

We are given a set of **batteries** connected to the electric grid via a **shared cable**. The goal is to determine a discharge schedule that minimizes the **total discharge time**, under several **capacity and constraint limitations**.

### Problem Description

Each battery:
- Has a fixed **capacity** in ampere-hours (Ah),
- Has a **minimum** and **maximum** allowed **discharge rate** in amperes (A),
- Once **discharging starts**, it cannot be interrupted,
- Discharges at a **constant rate**.

The **shared cable** has these limitations:
- It can handle at most **40A** total at any given moment,
- A maximum of **2 batteries** can be discharging **simultaneously**.

The task is to:
- Decide **when** to start discharging each battery,
- Choose a **discharge rate** (within limits) for each battery,
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied,
- **Minimize** the **total discharge duration** (i.e., time when the last battery finishes).

### Input Example

```minizinc
nBatteries = 3;

bat_capacity = [100, 150, 120];       % Capacity in Ah
max_discharge = [20, 10, 20];         % Max discharge rate in A
min_discharge = [5, 2, 7];            % Min discharge rate in A
```


### Output Variables
-  `start[i]`: time when battery `i` starts discharging
-  `discharge_rate[i]`: selected discharge current for battery `i` (within bounds)
-  `duration[i]`: how long battery `i` discharges (based on rate)
-  `discharge_ends`: time when the **last** battery finishes discharging

### Example Output (Optimal)

```minizinc
start = [6, 0, 0]; 
duration = [5, 15, 6]; 
discharge_rate = [20, 10, 20]; 
discharge_ends = 15;
```

### Interpretation:
- Battery 1: starts at time 6, discharges at 20A for 5 - minutes (100 Ah)
- Battery 2: starts at time 0, discharges at 10A for 15 - minutes (150 Ah)
- Battery 3: starts at time 0, discharges at 20A for 6 - minutes (120 Ah)
- Overall discharge ends at time 15


### Constraints Summary

-  `min_discharge[i] ≤ discharge_rate[i] ≤ max_discharge[i]`
-  At any moment:
    - At most 2 batteries are discharging
    - Total current ≤ 40A
-   Battery discharging is non-preemptive
-   Start times and discharge rates should be optimized to **minimize `discharge_ends`**
