## Problem Overview: Client/Server Allocation

This problem focuses on the optimal allocation of services requested by clients to edge servers in a distributed system. Each client requests exactly one service, and every service consumes a specific amount of **network resources**. Depending on which server the service is deployed on, the **networking cost** varies. Additionally, each server has a limited **capacity**, and if used, incurs a fixed **deployment cost**.

The objective is to **minimize the total cost**, which includes:
- The **deployment costs** of all active servers (i.e., servers assigned at least one service),
- The **networking costs**, which depend on the client demands and their assigned server.

### Problem Description

- Each **client** requests one service with a defined **resource demand**.
- Each **server** has:
  - A fixed **capacity** (maximum total demand it can support),
  - A fixed **deployment cost** (incurred only if at least one service is assigned to it).
- The **networking cost per unit** of resource differs by service and server. 
    - The total networking cost of a task is computed as: `NetworkingCost[client, server] * ClientDemands[client]`
- Each service must be assigned to exactly **one server**.
- A server cannot exceed its total capacity.

### Input Example

```minizinc
Servers = 4;                             % Number of servers
Clients = 6;                             % Number of clients (one service per client)

Capacity = [30, 40, 60, 60];                % Capacity of each server
DeploymentCost = [860, 350, 440, 580];      % Fixed cost per active server
ClientDemands = [12, 17, 5, 13, 20, 25];    % Demand per client

NetworkingCost = [
    |27, 66, 44, 55
    |53, 89, 68, 46
    |17, 40, 18, 61
    |20, 68, 44, 78
    |42, 89, 65, 78 
    |57, 55, 49, 31|];  % Cost per unit demand per server
```

### Output Example (Optimal Allocation)
```minizinc
client_allocation = [
  [0, 0, 12, 0]     % Client 1 assigned to server 3 (12 units)
  [0, 0, 0, 17]     % Client 2 assigned to server 4 (17 units)
  [0, 0, 5,  0]     % Client 3 assigned to server 3 (5 units)
  [0, 0, 13, 0]     % Client 4 assigned to server 3 (13 units)
  [0, 0, 20, 0]     % Client 5 assigned to server 3 (20 units)
  [0, 0, 0, 25]     % Client 6 assigned to server 4 (25 units)
];
client_allocation = [0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 13, 0, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 25]; 
total_cost = 5067;
```

This means:
-  Servers 3, and 4 are active, and their deployment costs are included.
-  The `total_cost` is the sum of all **deployment costs** for active servers and **networking costs** for all services.



### Objective

Minimize the total cost, defined as:

```minizinc
total_cost = sum_of_networking_costs + sum_of_deployment_costs;
```
