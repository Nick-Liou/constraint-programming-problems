## Problem Overview: Energy Storing Pumps Scheduling

In a hydroelectric energy storage station, **nPumps** transfer water from a low to a high reservoir using **excess renewable energy**. Each pump can be in one of three modes:

- `OFF`: Pump is not operating.
- `P050`: Operating at 50% capacity.
- `P100`: Operating at 100% capacity.

Each pump:
<!-- - **Consumes energy** depending on its mode. -->
- **Contributes to storing energy** (depending on its mode).
- Must go `OFF` for **at least 1 day** of **maintenance** after **accumulating 200% capacity** (e.g., 2 × `P100` or 4 × `P050` or any mix summing to 200%).

### Goal

Design a **daily schedule** for each pump over `nDays`, choosing for each day one of the three states: `OFF`, `P050`, or `P100`.  
**Objective**: Minimize the **total energy lost** (i.e., energy available but not absorbed).

---

### Input Example

```minizinc
nDays = 10;
nPumps = 3;

% Pump capacity per mode [P050, P100, OFF]
consumption = [
  |20, 35, 0|     % Pump 1
  |10, 15, 0|     % Pump 2
  |5,  15, 0|     % Pump 3
];

% Available energy to store each day
energy2store = [45, 25, 20, 10, 10, 40, 20, 10, 10, 30];
```

### Output Variables
`schedule`: Array (`nPumps` × `nDays`) of mode values (`OFF`, `P050`, `P100`) for each pump and day.

`lost`: Total unused energy (excess not absorbed due to capacity/mode constraints).

### Example Output

%  P050  OFF  OFF P050 P050 P100  OFF P050 P050 P100
%  P100 P050  OFF  OFF  OFF P050  OFF  OFF  OFF P100
% % Raw Data in Tables ------------

lost= 0;
```

### Constraints

  -  Pump Operation Limits:
      - Track cumulative operation level over consecutive days.
      - If a pump reaches or exceeds 200% total effort, must be OFF the next day.
      - Any OFF day resets the accumulated usage to 0.
  -  Energy Usage Limit:
      -  On any given day, the total energy consumed across all pumps must not exceed `energy2store[day]`.
      -  If pump demand > available energy → energy is lost.
   - Mode Logic:
      - Only valid transitions: OFF → P050/P100 or stay in same mode.
      - Can go to OFF any time.
