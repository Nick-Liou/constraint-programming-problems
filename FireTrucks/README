## Problem Overview: FireTrucks Scheduling

In this problem, we are tasked with scheduling the **refueling and servicing** of a fleet of firetrucks at a fire station.

There are:
- **3 water hydrants**, each capable of refilling water at a rate of **50 kg/minute**,
- **1 mobile service unit**, which can inspect/maintain one firetruck at a time.

Each **firetruck** must:
1. **Be refilled with water** (the duration depends on the truck's water capacity),
2. **Undergo service** by the mobile service unit (duration is truck-specific).

The goal is to **schedule both operations** for each truck such that:
- Resource constraints (hydrants and service unit) are respected,
- The **makespan** (total time until the last truck is done) is **minimized**,
- We also track the **total active time** of the service unit (from start of the first service to end of last).

### Input Example

```minizinc
no_firetrucks = 6;
water_cap = [1200, 900, 1500, 800, 1300, 600];     % Water capacity per truck (kg)
service_time = [15, 10, 20, 10, 5, 20];            % Time needed by the mobile unit per truck (min)
```

### Constants
```minizinc
hydrants = 3;                   % Number of water hydrants
refill_rate = 50;               % Each hydrant can refill 50 kg/min
```

### Output Variables

- `start_fill[i]`: time when firetruck `i` starts refueling
- `start_service[i]`: time when firetruck `i` starts service
- `makespan`: total time of the schedule (when last operation ends)
- `total_service`: time interval from the start of the first service to the end of the last (excluding idle gaps is not needed)

### Output Example (Optimal)
```minizinc
start_fill=[0, 30, 0, 24, 12, 0];
start_service=[52, 82, 32, 67, 77, 12];
total_service = 80;
makespan=92;
```

This means:
-  Truck 1 starts refueling at time 0, and service at time 52.
-  Truck 2 starts refueling at time 30, and service at time 82.
-  total_service = 80 minutes: from first service at 12 to last service ending at 92.
-  The makespan of the entire schedule is 92 minutes.


### Constraints
-  No hydrant can refill more than one truck at the same time.
-  The mobile unit can only service one truck at a time.
-  Service for a truck can only start after its refueling is finished.

### Objective

Minimize the `makespan`
